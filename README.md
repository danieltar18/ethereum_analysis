# Ethereum analysis ![alt text](https://cryptologos.cc/logos/ethereum-eth-logo.png?v=026)



Welcome,

I'm Daniel Tar from Hungary. I wrote my master thesis about Ethereum and ether price prediction. 
I collected multiple timeseries beside ETH, like Gold, NASDAQ, S&P500, Twitter tweet sentiments etc.
Sources folder is missing due to GDPR and Licensing things, so you have to scrape it for yourself. 

Models, that I've tested
- Naive
- Holt-Winters
- Arima
- Var
- XGBRegressor
- LSTM (Pytorch)
